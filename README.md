Convert AudioUnit plugins presets from various vendors to the standard aupreset file format so they can be used with Ableton Live and other DAWs.

# TODO
- Ableton doesn't see Satin generated presets
- Specify presets destination in command
- Move config to separate .yml file
- Move converters classes to their own files
- Nicer config solution than load_config?
- Extract common code between grouping patches/banks

# Pending plugins
- SynthMaster2
- XILS 4
- Z3TA+ 2
- KarmaFX Synth
- chipsounds
- minimoogVOriginalAU
- Reaktor 6
